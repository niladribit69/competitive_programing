Given a struct array of type Height, having two elements feet and inches. Find the maximum height, where height is calculated sum of feet and inches after converting feet into inches.

Input:
First line of input contains number of testcases. For each testcase, first line of input contains N, number of given heights. Next line contains 2*N number of elements (feet and inches for each N).

Output:
Output maximum height from array.

Your Task: Your task is to only complete the function of find maximum height from given array.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=105
0<=Feet, Inches<=105

Example:
Input:
2
2
1 2 2 1
4
3 5 7 9 5 6 5 5
Output:
25
93

Explanation:
Testcase 1: (1, 2) and (2, 1) are respective given heights. After converting both heigths in to inches, we get 14 and 25 as respective heights. So, 25 is the maximum height.
