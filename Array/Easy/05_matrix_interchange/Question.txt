Working with 2D arrays is quite important. Here we will do swapping of columns in a 2D array. You are given a matrix M of r rows and c columns. You need to swap the first column with the last column.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains T, the number of testcases. T testcases follow. Each testcase contains two lines of input. The first line contains r and c, separated by a space. The next r lines contains c elements of the matrix, separated by spaces.

Output Format:
For each testcase, in a new line, print the modified matrix.

Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take any input. Just complete the provided function interchange(int ,  int ) that take rows and columns number as parameter.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= r,c <= 100

Example:
Input:
1
3 4
1 2 3 4
4 3 2 1
6 7 8 9
Output:
4 2 3 1
1 3 2 4
9 7 8 6
