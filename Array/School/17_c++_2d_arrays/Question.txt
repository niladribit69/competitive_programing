Given an 2-d array of integers having N*N elements, print the transpose of the array. 

Input: 
The first line of input contains integer T denoting the number of test cases.  For each test case there will be two lines. First line contains an integer N denoting the size of the array A, and second line contains N*N space seperated integers of 2-d array A.

Output: 
For each test case, print the transpose of the array.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 100
0 <= A[i] <= 1000

Example:
Input:
1
3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Output:
1 4 7 2 5 8 3 6 9
